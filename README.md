This repository demonstrates a common Python error involving type errors in calculations and provides a solution. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code. It calculates the average of a list but fails when it encounters non-numeric values. The `bugSolution.py` file offers a corrected version that handles this gracefully and also deals with empty lists to prevent ZeroDivisionError.  The solution focuses on robust error handling for improved code reliability.
